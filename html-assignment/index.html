<p>Hi! I'm <em>Yiyun Cao</em> and I'm from China. My pronouns are she/her. I like music, movies, fictionsâ€¦anything that sparks my imagination. I enjoy having <b>thought-provoking conversations</b> with my friends, <b>exploring countless possibilities</b> on any interesting subjects(such as mysterious things).</p>

<p>I found this program match my interests. I like learning adobe software, it gives me sense of achievements. I got excited every time I create something new. Learning is much more enjoyable compare many things in life. Life is tough after all.</p>

<p>I hope I can create my own website one day with knowledge of coding. To be honest, I was afraid of coding before(it seems really difficult to me). But I started to have interests in coding(thanks to the cat theme on first week) and I  <b>looking forward to learn solid skills</b>. I really want to learn <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>perfectly.</p>
